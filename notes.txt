For my own sanity

Need to figure out a way to inject secrets into the Docker image.
Currently I run container and set secrets as env variables. Not the best.

Need to make sure the working directory is the /home/blacksmith directory. 
Creation of an app outside of this directory leads to denied permissions.

This will likely work better as a dev container. Then I can access project details and mount secrets easier.

On this step(unless I want to re-visit dev container): https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/build-a-hello-world-app-in-jira/

forge create
forge deploy
forge install

will need to set env variables via: https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/getting-started/#using-environment-variables-to-login
